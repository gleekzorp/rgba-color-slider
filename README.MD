# RGBA SLIDERS

- The box's background color changes based on the Red, Green, Blue, and Alpha Values
- The box also renders the current rgb or rgba value to easily copy and paste into your code
- Values are changed with a slider per the value of each slider

## TODO:

- [ ] Current box font color is white.  Need to come up with a plan for when the font is hard to see.
- [ ] Make the project mobile friendly.  Currently only works on desktop.
